# DSAI 2201 - Course Final Assignment

This Jupyter project was completed as a DSAI 2201 requirement. This project uses the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database'>Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset</a>. **Assignment 1** included data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering tasks while **assignment 2** focused on model selection and improvement. Libraries such as **Pandas**, **numPy**, and **sci-kit** were used to accomplish the aforementioned tasks. 

The models I created were tasked with predicting whether a patient has a risk of diabetes or not. I selected the target features which will be most suitable for predicting the label through analyzing a correlation heatmap. Afterwards, I also attempted to engineer new features to refine the prediction accuracy. Lastly, I tried various Machine Learning models and used metrics (i.e. recall rate and MAE) to conclude which ML model is suited best for predicting diabetes.
